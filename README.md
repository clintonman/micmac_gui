# micmac_gui
Graphical user interface for the MicMac Photogrammetry software collection

The main javascript libraries used to create the GUI are Electron, React and Threejs. The packager is setup for Windows 64bit, Debian Linux and OSX. The OSX version does have some issues that may be because of the old age of the Mac used to develop and test it, a 2006 machine running OSX 10.11.6
